## Abstract
Deep learning models have shown remarkable performance in electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis, but the limited availability and size of ECG datasets have constrained their success, resulting in systems that are more task specialists than versatile generalists. To counter this, we introduce HuBERT-ECG, a novel self-supervised foundation ECG model pre-trained on a large and diverse dataset of 9.1 million 12-lead ECGs encompassing 164 cardiovascular conditions. By simply adding a proper output layer, HuBERT-ECG can be fine-tuned for a wide array of downstream tasks, from diagnosing diseases to predicting future cardiovascular events. Across diverse real-world scenarios, HuBERT-ECG achieves AUROCs from 0.843 on small datasets to 0.99 on larger sources. When fine-tuned to detect 164 overlapping conditions simultaneously, our model delivers AUROCs above 0.9 and 0.95 for up to 140 and 97 diseases, respectively. HuBERT-ECG can also predict death events within a 2-year follow-up with AUROCs up to 0.91. We release pre-trained models and code as building baselines.

## Installation
Clone this repository and install all the necessary dependecies written in the `requirements.txt` file with ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.
Full installation time may take up to 1 minute.

## Reproducibility
In the `reproducibility` folder you can find all train, validation, and test splits we used in our work as .csv files. You simply have to follow the instructions in the `reproducibility/README.md` to reproduce our results.
In the `finetune.sh`, there is ready-to-launch code for reproduce fine-tuning of pre-trained models while in the `test.sh` scfipt there's the code for evaluation of fine-tuned models.
Similarly, `train_from_scratch` allows you to replicate every training from scratch, that is, train in a fully supervised manner the same models with random initialization. `inference_from_training_from_scratch.sh` contains the code to run evaluation of these trained-from-scratch models.
The forward pass on a single instance takes less than 1 second on an A100 GPU node, which is also the machine we ran our experiments and evaluations on.
Experiments on `Google Colab` show that even the LARGE model size can easily fit into a T4 GPU.
The splits were used in cross-validation experiments/evaluations to also mitigate the performance difference that can be be observed when using different hardware and machiens.
